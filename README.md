## Features

- Highly customizable: before beginning your test, you have fine-grained control over which root notes and chord types you'd like to play.
- Simplistic interface: kind of like monkeytype in that it only shows you what you need to see
- Free: ad free, payment free, scam free, formaldehyde free, free next week, you name it. But, please ⭐️**STAR THIS REPOSITORY**⭐️ in the interest of [sending me to a private island hackathon](https://shipwrecked.hackclub.com/).
- MIDI keyboard support: uses WEBMIDI.js to deliver you stunning low-latency midi-enabled goodness.
- Regular keyboard support: uses javascript event listners to deliver you stunning, low-latency computer keyboard support.
- Learn mode: a mode that highlights the notes you need to play for each chord. 99% judgement free.

## Beta testing

> *By playing midigym right now, you agree to being a beta tester. Already played? Too late, beta tester!*

The site is *very* incomplete, and although I have tried to polish it as much as possible, please be aware that you are playing an incomplete version of the site. There are many features that some would consider necessary for the site to achieve its goals (see To-do) that are not present right now. When you play, *please* to [contact me](linktr.ee/archonic) with any small suggestions/personal gripes you may have with the site. If you find a **reproducable bug** or have a **comprehensive suggestion for a new feature**, please make a new post on the [issues page](https://github.com/Archonic944/midigym/issues).

## Contributing

I am open to any and all contributions!

> *No, not desparate enough...*

PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE CONTRIBUTE!!! Fork and make a pull request, suggest new features, mail patches to my house, ANYTHING!!

Large additions are ok, but try not to go overboard (or at least open an issue so we can talk about it before you do)!
